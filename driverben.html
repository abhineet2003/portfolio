            Our initial observations highlighted safety concerns and societal
            disapproval affecting female drivers, as well as practical issues
            like the distance to training grounds. These observations led us to
            explore the daily realities faced by individuals involved in the
            program.

            By examining daily routines, we uncovered how these safety concerns

            household responsibilities with training. This deeper look showed
            the personal and logistical challenges trainees face.

            capturing their feelings, challenges, and needs to understand their
            perspectives and identify key emotional and practical issues
            impacting their experiences with the Driverben program.

            Amita Ben, who faced challenges but found hope in the Driverben
            program. In our video, we share a girl's story through a discovered
            diary, showing her struggles and eventual success as a driver. It's
            a reminder of the power of programs like Driverben to empower
            individuals and change lives for the better.
